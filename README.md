<p>
<strong>Stage 1: Intake</strong><br />
Tickets can be created manually by users via the client portal, automatically by incoming emails, or directly by agents. Each ticket is timestamped and includes a help topic that routes it to the correct department.

<p>
<strong>Stage 2: Assignment and Communication</strong><br />
Once created, tickets are automatically assigned based on the help topic or can be manually assigned by an agent. Internal notes or responses can be added, and communication begins with the user to clarify the issue.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Stage 3: Working the Issue</strong><br />
The assigned agent works to resolve the issue. They may escalate it to another department, attach files, request more information, or mark it as pending while awaiting a response from the user.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Stage 4: Resolution</strong><br />
Once the issue is resolved, the agent updates the status to “Closed.” The user is notified and may re-open the ticket if the issue persists. osTicket keeps a record of the entire interaction for auditing and reference.
